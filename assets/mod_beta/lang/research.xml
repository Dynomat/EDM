		<name>Interdimensional Glass</name>
		<popupText>Circumvent the physical restrictions of matter.</popupText>
		<longText>Interested in the spartial properties of the Eldritch, you wonder if it were possible to apply it on certain materials without fully shifting the outside this dimension...</longText>
		<page type="text">By only partially warping spacetime through the crystalline structure of glass you have created a material that is virtually intangable: anything solid will phase right through while light, liquids and gasses can properly interact with it.
However, applying a redstone current grounds it in space and effectively nullifies its supernatural properties.
